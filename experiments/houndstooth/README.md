# Houndstooth
## What it is
Houndstooth is prototype for a Stripe-like payments tool. At a glance, the high-level overview of Houndstooth, is to allow users to enter their payment information in a simple and pleasing way, built specifically with vendor integration in mind.  Beyond this, however, Houndstooth is primarily a way for me to try out fun new ES6 features which I don't get to play with at work, and as such, all JavaScript code in Houndstooth is my own, including functionality which I would normally pull in
via libraries such as lodash, React, and so on.
